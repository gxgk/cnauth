## Use under *general Linux distrubutions*
Just `make` (`gcc` as `cc` while `g++` as `cxx` by default).

## Use under *OpenWRT*
You may need a crossing-platform compiler to create corresponding link files. Recommanded means are as follows:
### For *Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell Residential Gateway 100A (RG100A)*
It is recommanded to use `opwnwrt-gcc-rg100a` as `cc`, `openwrt-g++-rg100a` as `cxx` and then execute `make PF=rg100a`.

### For *Huawei HG255d*
It is recommanded to use `opwnwrt-gcc-hg255d` as `cc`, `openwrt-g++-hg255d` as `cxx` and then execute `make PF=hg255d`.
